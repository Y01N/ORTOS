ORTOS (Open Roundnet Tournament Organization Software) - Eoin O‚ÄôGara and Kolton Knight

Mission Statement:
Create a community driven open source hub for roundnet tournament management.

Details:
This hub will excel at connecting the community to local tournaments and clubs. The site plans to offer a more flexible approach to tournaments by supporting leagues, squad formats, etc. Emancipating tournament organization software from the grasp of Spikeball Inc. is crucial for the development of roundnet as a sport and will open doors for new features that Spikeball Inc. has resisted implementing to Fwango as well as opportunities for better growth of local roundnet communities.
